# Tahoe-100M Dataset Exploration

This repository contains my initial exploration and analysis of the Tahoe-100M dataset.  
As a Master's student in Bioengineering with a background in Data Science, I'm interested in leveraging large-scale datasets to uncover insights related to human health, movement, and behavior.

## Goals
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Identify trends and patterns in the data
- Apply ML models for potential downstream applications

## Tools
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Google Colab
